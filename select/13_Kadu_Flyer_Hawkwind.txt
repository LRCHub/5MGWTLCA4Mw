I want to try, I want to be me
I want to get high, I want you to see
I want to fly, I want to be free
I hit the trail from Kathmandu
With a different kind of trip in view
Everest is behind the town
Mountain High-bound to get higher
My glider high, the Kadu Flyer
Cygnus of the skies, the prize
And I will rise to win it
Never fly through a cloud
If there's a mountain in it

My route is by the steep ascent
Do battle with the elements
Peaks of progress, freezing winds
Downdraft angels want to drag me down
And straining ailerons the only sound
And ere we fly the keening wind in the dandelions die
Everest, I'll never rest
I'll see you a mogul when I'm high

I want to try, I want to be me
I want to get high, I want you to see
I want to fly, I want to be free
Crawl the thermal up a mountain
Like the Pteradacyl's wings
Waves of lift and hidden vibrations
Help me to invoke the sun
True me up in soaring fun
Rising like the phoenix
In full flight from the fire
A dragon wing of string and sticks
Gliding higher and higher and higher

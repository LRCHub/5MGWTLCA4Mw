Have you ever met a frequent flyer
Dressed in all white attire
Sippin' on a gray's papaya
Wanna take you higher (higher)

Jet lag you must be tired
Watch out you might misfire
Anything your heart desires
Wanna take you higher (higher)

Influential moving past your security
Presidential real utensils priority

Higher (higher), higher
1, 2, 3 you and me
Can you move at my velocity?
Higher (higher), higher
Don't miss a beat
First class seat upon my fleet

When you hear the beat
When you feel the need
Turn the cabin pressure on
Hurry cause I'll soon be gone
My instincts never lie
And you're right up my aisle
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
Put the freak in the frequent flyer

Yep it's the boy with glasses
Giving you boarding passes
And if the flight's delayed
You might miss all your morning classes

Trust me girl you look dashing
Even with your seatbelt fastened
Are you into fashion?
Cause I noticed our outfits are matching

Influential moving past your security
Presidential real utensils priority

Higher (higher), higher
1, 2, 3 you and me
Can you move at my velocity?
Higher (higher), higher
Don't miss a beat
First class seat upon my fleet

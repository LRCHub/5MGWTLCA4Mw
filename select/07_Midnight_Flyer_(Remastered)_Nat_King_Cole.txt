Midnight Flyer
Take me to L.
Midnight Flyer
Take me to L.
A. There'll be a whole lot of kissing
When I jump off that Santa Fe Midnight Flyer
Roll on down the track
Midnight Flyer
Roll on down the track The quicker I get there
The sooner I'll get her back A pocket full of money
A heart full of pain
I won't be myself
Until I see her again Midnight Flyer
Take me to L.
Midnight Flyer
Take me to L.
A. There'll be a whole lot of loving
When I jump off that Santa Fe A pocket full of money
A heart full of pain
I won't be myself
Until I see her again I got a whole lot of dust
On my dancing shoes
And I've got a lot of loving
That I haven't ued Midnight Flyer
Midnight Flyer
Be on your way Midnight Flyer
Be on your way
Midnight Flyer
Be on your way

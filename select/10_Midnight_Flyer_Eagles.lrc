[00:18.01] Oo, Midnight Flyer
[00:23.05] Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
[00:26.68] Oo, Midnight Flyer
[00:33.23] I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
[00:54.73] 
[00:37.49] A runaway team of horses ain't enough to make me stay
[00:40.75] So throw your rope on another man
[00:43.16] And pull him down your way
[00:45.31] Make him into someone who can take the place of me
[00:48.48] Make him every kind of fool you wanted me to be
[01:11.98] 
[00:52.97] Oo, Midnight Flyer
[01:00.89] Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
[01:03.81] Oo, Midnight Flyer,
[01:10.40] I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
[01:15.52] Maybe I'll go to Santa Fe, maybe San Antone,
[01:18.79] Any town is where I'm bound any way to get me gone
[01:22.56] Don't think about me, never let me cross your mind
[01:26.52] 'Cept when you hear that midnight lonesome whistle whine
[01:54.52] 
[01:31.03] Oo, Midnight Flyer
[01:38.75] Engineer, won't you let your whistle moan?
[01:42.30] Oo, Midnight Flyer
[01:48.41] I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
[01:53.04] I paid my dues and I feel like trav'lin' on
